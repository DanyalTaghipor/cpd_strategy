# Trading Strategy: CPD with Ichimoku

This repository contains the implementation of the ```CPD``` trading strategy, which is based on the Ichimoku technical indicator. The strategy has been developed using the [Freqtrade](https://www.freqtrade.io/) platform.

## Overview

The primary function of this project is to determine trade signals based on the ```CPD``` strategy with the Ichimoku indicator. Once a signal is identified, it is dispatched to a Telegram channel for further action or notification.

The project is structured to operate within a microservices architecture, making use of Docker Swarm for orchestration.

## Services

### 1. Freqtrade

This service is responsible for the implementation and execution of the ```CPD``` strategy. It monitors market data, applies the strategy logic, and identifies trade signals.

### 2. Plotter

The __Plotter__ service takes the signals generated by the Freqtrade service and sends them to a specified Telegram channel. It acts as a bridge between the trading logic and the end-users on Telegram.

## Deployment

This project is designed to run in a Docker Swarm environment. Each service (Freqtrade and Plotter) is containerized and orchestrated using Swarm.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Swarm are installed and initialized on your machine.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory and deploy the services using:

   ```bash
   docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml cpd
   ```

4. Monitor the logs or connect to the respective services for detailed operations.
